Java Agent-Based Modelling Framework - large scale flocking behaviour on quadtree 

### Topic: Java Agent-Based Modelling Framework - large scale flocking behaviour on quadtree 
### Author: Eugene Ch'ng [Academic Blog](http://www.complexity.io/)
### Purpose: Prepared for the ERC Advanced Research Grant 'Lost Frontiers' Scalable Agent-Based Modelling Team Training.
### Audience: For students and researchers needing a quick approach to learning agent-based modelling foundation for C++ and OpenGL

## INTRODUCTION
The code presented here is now a 'systems-level' development, as a 'sketch' for more serious C++ code development in my repositories for the ERC 'Lost Frontiers' Advanced Research Grant. The Quadtree Terrain System is composed of a set of decoupled classes, each for managing objects within the ABM system:

- Quadtree agent interaction
- Hierarchical object-oriented code for polymorphic behaviour
- Flocking implementation tested on quadtree interaction for large scale simulation
